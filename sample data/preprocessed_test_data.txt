796	426	5.0	love them!  i wear the to the gym, to sleep in, to run to the market in.  They always fit and i really like these blue ones.  I normally get white.  Oh and by the way-I'm a 60+ woman and I look really cute in Calvin Klein T-Shirts.  ;-)
873	431	3.0	Great product if you are going to have it tacked on by machine. The two pin clip system just did not work for me. snug on the bottom but space on top. the ribbon needed to be designed somewhat concave. I am keeping it because I am going to have it permanently attached by machine.
2598	786	4.0	The mens V-Creeper 509 is a surprisingly comfortable shoe. I owned 2 pair back in my punk/goth youth (yes, the 80's) and as much as I loved them back then, they were never that comfortable. The quality of the shoe its self Im finding to be top notch as well. So, if you're a youngster or an old geezer like me...do yourself a favor, and getchya some of these creepers.
2599	786	4.0	These Shoes would have been awesome, I wear a size 10, but the size 10's in these shoes did not fit me. It would be nice if they would offer a 7.5 Thanks anyways!
2601	786	5.0	I received my men's V creeper 509 today and was blown away! The service and quality I experienced was superb. The customer service rep was fantastic ! I will definitely buy another pair of shoes in the immediate future.Thank you
3768	861	2.0	Both the small and medium were too small.  Very unlike typical sizing!
4688	1013	3.0	Same fit, but they have gone to a much lighter weight fabric. I don't expect these to hold up like my previous pair.
4692	1013	4.0	I was looking for a fairly lightweight work pant that was a relaxed fit. These fit great and don't bunch up when I have to squat down. As I live in the deep south, they feel fairly light and not hot. I plan on buying several more
4694	1013	5.0	as expected
4697	1013	1.0	I wear Carhartt all day, every day  Various models, all blue or duck.  I wear a 34" waist (way too loose, but I wear many layers) and a tight belt.  Bought these in my usual size because I needed something a little more formal (this is as formal as I get) with "normal" colors.  I laundered with confidence, as I always do - cold wash/delicate dry - and was shocked when I put these on.  Way too tight in the waist could barely breathe.  I had two days of business to conduct so I wore them, regardless.  Have not worn since and will give to charity.  Had I not had some unexpected business, I would have returned.  Terribly disappointed.
